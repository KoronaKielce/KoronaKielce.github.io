    <h1>A history of Rocks</h1>
    <p>Rocks are a type of animal located in Death Valley<br>
    It is unknown when rocks were invented, but most historians assume they were invented in 1953</p>
  
    <br>
   
    <p>For some time the rocks were able to get along having a bronze age farmer lifestyle</p>
    <img src="images/farmernew.jpg" alt="farmer" width="25%">
    <p>However after a neighborly argument the rocks ended up getting attacked by the nearby planes, who were very mean :(</p>
    <p>Nowadays, rocks live in diaspora throughout Washington, mostly because of the great rock divide in 2008</p>
    <p>If you ever step outside to take a breath of air in, you may very well see a rock hiding under a tree!</p>
